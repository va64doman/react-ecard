# E-card

In reference of the Tobaku Mokushiroku Kaiji.

## How to play

There are three cards:

* Emperor
* Citizen
* Slave

The Emperor has ultimate power to give money (ie. most powerful card). Citizens cannot disobey him because they want money (i.e. Citizen loses to Emperor). The Slave has nothing to lose and has no use of money, therefore the slave can defeat the Emperor (i.e. The Slave loses to the Citizen card but wins over the Emperor card).

The game is played with one side having four Citizen cards and an Emperor card (Emperor side). The other side having four Citizen cards and a Slave card (Slave side). Since it is much harder for the slave side to win (as Slave cards can only defeat Emperor cards) the players of the Slave side get five times more winnings. Each game is played with 12 matches each match having each player set down one card.

The 12 matches is separated into 4 groups of rounds, with each group alternating which player is the Emperor Side. Each group of rounds are made of 3 rounds.

In the first of the 3 rounds the Emperor Side plays a card faced down first, followed by the Slave Side. Each card is then revealed and the winner decided.

If the outcome is a draw then the round continues to a second play with the played cards removed. Now the slave side will start by placing a card, followed by the emperor side.

If this play is a draw again, then the round moves onto the last play of that round - even if it is another draw Here the emperor side will place a card first.

Once the round is concluded, all played cards are collected and the next round starts, with now the Slave Side playing a card first (even if the previous round ended with the Slave Side placing first). If this play is a draw, the round continues to the next play, with the Emperor side placing first.

Once the second round is concluded, play out the third round starting with the emperor side again.

Once those 3 rounds are finished the first group of rounds are complete. Both players now swap their hands so that the Emperor Side is now the Slave Side, and the Slave side is now the Emperor Side.

Again, the emperor side plays the first card in the first round (which will be the 4th round overall).

After the 6th round in total (the 3rd round of the second group of rounds), swap sides once again. Do this again after the 9th round in total (after the 3rd round of the second group of rounds.

Once all 12 rounds have been played, you can determine a winner.

## How to run this project

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
